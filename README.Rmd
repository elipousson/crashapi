The goal of the crashapi R package is to provide functions for downloading data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) [Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) API](https://crashviewer.nhtsa.dot.gov/CrashAPI/).

What is FARS? NHTSA explains: "The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) contains data on all vehicle crashes in the United States that occur on a public roadway and involve a fatality."

Supported APIs for this package include:

-   [x] Get Crash List Information
-   [X] Get Crash Details
-   [x] Get Crashes By Location
-   [X] Get Crashes By Vehicle
-   [x] Get Summary Counts
-   [x] Get Variables and Get Variable Attributes
-   [x] Get FARS Data By Year

Most of these APIs support XML, JSV, CSV, and JSON output formats. This package only uses JSON with the exception of get_fars_year (which supports downloading CSV files).

Currently unsupported APIs include:

-   [ ] Get Crashes By Occupant

For reference, this package also includes a list of terms and NHTSA technical definitions in `fars_terms` and a list of variable labels in `fars_vars_labels`.

The FARS API currently only provides access to data from 2010 to 2019. The `get_fars_zip` function can be used to access FARS data files from 1975 to 2019 that that are available for download on through [the NHTSA File Downloads site](https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/) as zipped CSV or SAS files (not available through the NHTSA FARS API). This site also provides extensive technical documentation on coding and use of the FARS data files.

Earlier data along with data from the the [General Estimates System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/national-automotive-sampling-system-nass/nass-general-estimates-system) (GES) / [Crash Report Sampling System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/crash-data-systems/crash-report-sampling-system-crss) (CRSS) is also available through the [Fatality and Injury Reporting System Tool](https://cdan.dot.gov/query) (FIRST).

The [NHTSA website](https://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Help/helplinks.aspx) also provides additional information on the release data and version status for the FARS data files:

## Installation

You can install the development version of crashapi using the remotes package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("elipousson/crashapi")
```

## Examples

```{r}
library(crashapi)
library(ggplot2)
```

Most features for the package can be accessed using the `get_fars()` function that selects the appropriate API-specific function based on the provided parameters. You can also set the API to use with the `api` parameter or use an API-specific function (e.g. `get_fars_summary()`).

For example, you can use the `get_fars()` access state-level summary data on crash and fatality counts.

```{r get_fars_summary}
# Get summary crash count and fatality count data for Maryland from 2010 to 2019
md_summary <-
  get_fars(
    year = c(2010, 2019),
    state = "MD",
    api = "summary count"
  )

ggplot(md_summary, aes(x = CaseYear, y = TotalFatalCounts)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_line(color = "red", group = 1) +
  theme_minimal()
```

You can download crash data and set geometry to TRUE optionally convert the data frame into an `sf` object for mapping.

```{r map_fars_crashes}
crashes_sf <-
  get_fars(
  year = c(2010, 2012),
  state = "MD",
  county = "Baltimore city",
  geometry = TRUE
)

# Map crashes
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = mapbaltimore::baltimore_city,
    fill = NA, color = "black"
  ) +
  geom_sf(
    data = crashes_sf,
    aes(color = totalvehicles),
    alpha = 0.75
  ) +
  theme_void()
```

You can list crashes and filter by the number of vehicles involved.

```{r get_fars_crash_list}
# Get fatal crashes in New York state from 2019 with 5 to 10 vehicles
get_fars(
  year = 2019,
  state = "NY",
  vehicles = c(5, 10)
)
```

If you call `get_fars()` or `get_fars_crashes()` with details set to TRUE, additional information from `get_fars_cases()` (including the crash date and time) is appended to the crash data frame.

```{r get_fars_crashes}
# Get fatal crashes for Anne Arundel County, MD for 2019 and append details
crashes_detailed <- get_fars(
  year = 2019,
  state = "MD",
  county = "Anne Arundel County",
  details = TRUE
)

# Show 10 fatal crashes at random
dplyr::slice_sample(crashes_detailed, n = 10)
```
