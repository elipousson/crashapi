The goal of the crashapi R package is to provide functions for
downloading data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) [Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)
API](https://crashviewer.nhtsa.dot.gov/CrashAPI/).

What is FARS? NHTSA explains: “The Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS) contains data on all vehicle crashes in the United States that
occur on a public roadway and involve a fatality.”

## Installation

You can install the development version of crashapi using the pak
package:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("elipousson/crashapi")
```

## Background

### Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) API support

Supported APIs for this package include:

- [x] Get Crash List Information
- [x] Get Crash Details
- [x] Get Crashes By Location
- [x] Get Crashes By Vehicle
- [x] Get Summary Counts
- [x] Get Variables and Get Variable Attributes
- [x] Get FARS Data By Year
- [x] Get Crashes By Occupant (partial support)

Most of these APIs support XML, JSV, CSV, and JSON output formats. This
package only uses JSON with the exception of `get_fars_year()` (which
supports downloading CSV files).

For reference, this package also includes a list of terms and NHTSA
technical definitions in `fars_terms` and a list of variable labels in
`fars_vars_labels`.

The FARS API currently provides access to data from 2010 to 2022. The
[NHTSA website](https://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Help/helplinks.aspx) also
provides additional information on the release data and version status
for the FARS data files available through the API:

| Data Year | File Version | Release Date      |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 2010      | Final        | December 11, 2012 |
| 2011      | Final        | November 13, 2013 |
| 2012      | Final        | December 12, 2013 |
| 2013      | Final        | December 14, 2014 |
| 2014      | Final        | December 18, 2015 |
| 2015      | Final        | December 16, 2016 |
| 2016      | Final        | December 14, 2017 |
| 2017      | Final        | December 18, 2018 |
| 2018      | Final        | June 24, 2021     |
| 2019      | Final        | March 2, 2022     |
| 2020      | Final        | April 3, 2023     |
| 2021      | Final        | August 19, 2024   |
| 2022      | Annual       | August 19, 2024   |

### Additional data access functionality

The `get_fars_zip()` function can be used to access FARS data files from
1975 to 2020 that that are not available via the API but are available
for download on through [the NHTSA File Downloads
site](https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/) as
zipped CSV or SAS files (not available through the NHTSA FARS API). This
site also provides extensive technical documentation on coding and use
of the FARS data files.

Earlier data along with data from the the [General Estimates
System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/national-automotive-sampling-system-nass/nass-general-estimates-system)
(GES) / [Crash Report Sampling
System](https://www.nhtsa.gov/crash-data-systems/crash-report-sampling-system-crss)
(CRSS) is also available through the [Fatality and Injury Reporting
System Tool](https://cdan.dot.gov/query) (FIRST).

## Examples

``` r
library(crashapi)
library(ggplot2)
```

Most features for the package can be accessed using the `get_fars()`
function that selects the appropriate API-specific function based on the
provided parameters. You can also set the API to use with the `api`
parameter or use an API-specific function (e.g. `get_fars_summary()`).

For example, you can use the `get_fars()` access state-level summary
data on crash and fatality counts.

``` r
# Get summary crash count and fatality count data for Maryland from 2010 to 2019
md_summary <-
  get_fars(
    year = c(2010, 2021),
    state = "MD",
    api = "summary count"
  )

ggplot(md_summary, aes(x = CaseYear, y = TotalFatalCounts)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_line(color = "red", group = 1) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-get_fars_summary-1.png" width="100%" />

You can download crash data and set geometry to TRUE optionally convert
the data frame into an `sf` object for mapping.

``` r
crashes_sf <-
  get_fars(
    year = c(2018, 2021),
    state = "NC",
    county = "Wake County",
    geometry = TRUE
  )

nc <- sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))
#> Reading layer `nc' from data source 
#>   `/Users/elipousson/Library/R/arm64/4.4/library/sf/shape/nc.shp' 
#>   using driver `ESRI Shapefile'
#> Simple feature collection with 100 features and 14 fields

#> Geodetic CRS:  NAD27
wake_co <- sf::st_transform(nc[nc$NAME == "Wake", ], 4326)

# Map crashes
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = wake_co,
    fill = NA, color = "black"
  ) +
  geom_sf(
    data = sf::st_crop(crashes_sf, wake_co),
    aes(color = TOTALVEHICLES),
    alpha = 0.75
  ) +
  theme_void()
#> Warning in st_is_longlat(x): bounding box has potentially an invalid value
#> range for longlat data
#> Warning in st_is_longlat(x): bounding box has potentially an invalid value
#> range for longlat data
```

You can list crashes and filter by the number of vehicles involved.

``` r
# Get fatal crashes in New York state from 2019 with 5 to 10 vehicles
get_fars(
  year = 2019,
  state = "NY",
  vehicles = c(5, 10)
)

```

If you call `get_fars()` or `get_fars_crashes()` with details set to
TRUE, additional information from `get_fars_cases()` (including the
crash date and time) is appended to the crash data frame.

``` r
# Get fatal crashes for Anne Arundel County, MD for 2019 and append details
crashes_detailed <-
  get_fars(
    year = 2019,
    state = "MD",
    county = "Anne Arundel County",
    details = TRUE
  )
