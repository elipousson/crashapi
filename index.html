<p>The goal of the crashapi R package is to provide functions for downloading data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://crashviewer.nhtsa.dot.gov/CrashAPI/" class="external-link">Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) API</a>.</p>
<p>What is FARS? NHTSA explains: “The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) contains data on all vehicle crashes in the United States that occur on a public roadway and involve a fatality.”</p>

<p>You can install the development version of crashapi using the pak package:</p>

</h3>
<p>Supported APIs for this package include:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked>Get Crash List Information</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked>Get Crash Details</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked>Get Crashes By Location</label></li>

<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked>Get FARS Data By Year</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" checked>Get Crashes By Occupant (partial support)</label></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these APIs support XML, JSV, CSV, and JSON output formats. This package only uses JSON with the exception of <code><a href="reference/get_fars.html">get_fars_year()</a></code> (which supports downloading CSV files).</p>
<p>For reference, this package also includes a list of terms and NHTSA technical definitions in <code>fars_terms</code> and a list of variable labels in <code>fars_vars_labels</code>.</p>
<p>The FARS API currently provides access to data from 2010 to 2021. The <a href="https://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Help/helplinks.aspx" class="external-link">NHTSA website</a> also provides additional information on the release data and version status for the FARS data files available through the API:</p>

<p>The <code><a href="reference/get_fars_zip.html">get_fars_zip()</a></code> function can be used to access FARS data files from 1975 to 2020 that that are not available via the API but are available for download on through <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/" class="external-link">the NHTSA File Downloads site</a> as zipped CSV or SAS files (not available through the NHTSA FARS API). This site also provides extensive technical documentation on coding and use of the FARS data files.</p>

<p>Most features for the package can be accessed using the <code><a href="reference/get_fars.html">get_fars()</a></code> function that selects the appropriate API-specific function based on the provided parameters. You can also set the API to use with the <code>api</code> parameter or use an API-specific function (e.g. <code><a href="reference/get_fars.html">get_fars_summary()</a></code>).</p>
<p>For example, you can use the <code><a href="reference/get_fars.html">get_fars()</a></code> access state-level summary data on crash and fatality counts.</p>
