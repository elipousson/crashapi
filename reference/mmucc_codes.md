About MMUC from NHTSA: <https://www.nhtsa.gov/mmucc-1>

To encourage greater uniformity, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) and the Governors Highway Safety Association
(GHSA) cooperatively developed a voluntary data collection guideline in
1998. The MMUCC guideline identifies a minimum set of motor vehicle
crash data elements and their attributes that States should consider
collecting and including in their State crash data system.

The MMUCC 5th Edition is the result of an 18-month collaboration between
NHTSA, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), the National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB), the GHSA, and subject matter experts from State
DOTs, local law enforcement, emergency medical services, safety
organizations, industry partners, and academia. The traffic records
community and general public also contributed through external forums
(Federal Register) and at the 2016 Traffic Records Forum.
